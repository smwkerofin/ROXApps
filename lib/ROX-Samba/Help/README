                          Stephen Watson (stephen@kerofin.demon.co.uk)

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Samba client
  FUSE
  fusesmb
  ROX-Lib

Samba and FUSE should be included in any recent Linux distribution, but
fusesmb may need to be installed from source.  To edit the fusesmb.conf file 
you will need a ROX-Lib 2.0.4 or later.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As usual for a ROX application, copy it somewhere you can find it again...

Additionally you can use the Launch application 
(http://www.kerofin.demon.co.uk/rox/launch.html) to set it as the handler for 
smb: and cifs: URI's, allowing you to do things like

         rox -U smb://
