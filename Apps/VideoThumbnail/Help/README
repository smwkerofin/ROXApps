VideoThumbnail
==============

This application can generate thumbnails of video files, for display
by ROX-Filer.  It requires: 

* ROX-Filer CVS 2003-10-13 or later, or verson 2.1.1

* ROX-Lib2 CVS 2003-10-05 or later, or version 1.9.12

* MPlayer 0.90 or later.

Installation
------------

To install it, copy to your ~/Apps directory (or /usr/local/apps or
/usr/apps) and run it.  Click on install handlers and click on OK.
You can choose not to install it for some of the types.

File type support
-----------------

Version 0.0.1 supports the following MIME types:

* video/mpeg
* video/quicktime
* video/x-msvideo
* audio/x-pn-realaudio (which can be a video format)

It can also (in theory) support any file type that MPlayer can.  If
you find it works for more than those four please let me know.
