Load
====

Load is an applet for use in a ROX-Filer panel or pinboard.  It
displays the system load average (the number of processes wanting to
run at once) averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

The data is obtained in a portable way using libgtop (specifically
glibtop_get_loadavg). 

Three bars are plotted (for 1, 5 and 15 minute average).  Values up to
1 are plotted in green, above that in red.  Optionally the maximum
scale of the graph may be shown, also the individual values.
