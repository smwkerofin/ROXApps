Load
====

Load is an applet for use in a ROX-Filer panel or pinboard.  It
displays the system load average (the number of processes wanting to
run at once) averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

The data is obtained in a portable way using libgtop (specifically
glibtop_get_loadavg). 

If you click on the applet (or run the program outside an applet
context) you will get a top-level window which you can resize.

Compilation and Installation
----------------------------

To compile the program, simply run it from ROX-Filer (or run 
Load/AppRun --compile).  You will need these libraries
  * GTK+ 2
  * libgtop 2
  * libxml2
  * ROX-CLib

The program may be run from any location.  To install it, simply copy the 
application directory.

Display
-------

Three bars are plotted (for 1, 5 and 15 minute average).  Values up to
1 are plotted in green, above that in red (but you can change the
colours).

Optionally the maximum scale of the graph may be shown, also the
individual values.  You can also show the name of the host the program
is running on, which may be useful in a network environment.

The display scales to the size of its window.  If the width of the
window is sufficient then a strip chart of the 1 minute average is plotted.

Options
-------

To configure the program, click mouse button 3 to obtain the pop-up
menu, then click on "Configure".  The use of each option is:

Update rate (s): How often (in seconds) the display is updated.

Display: Optional elements to display

Initial size: Initial size of the window.  Changing this value will
	      have no effect until the next time the program is run.

Colour: Allows you to change the 6 colours used for plotting the bars.

Display font: The font used to label the graph.

OK: Save current values

Revert: Change back to saved values
