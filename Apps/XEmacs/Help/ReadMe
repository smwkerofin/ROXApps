XEmacs wrapper
==============

This wrapper should try to contact a running XEmacs and have that open
the file in a new frame, and if that fails to run XEmacs to load the
file. 

For this to work you will need the gnuclient program installed
alongside xemacs (should be part of the same distribution) and the
following lines in your $HOME/.emacs file:

  (defvar running-xemacs (string-match "XEmacs\\|Lucid"
    emacs-version))
  (cond (running-xemacs (gnuserv-start)
