README file for AppFactory
==========================

AppFactory is a program for automating the creation of ROX wrappers
for programs.

To use it, drag the executable you want to create the wrapper for onto
the program name line, an XPM file for the wrapper to the icon line
and a directory containing the help files to the help line.  The last
two are optional.  Then click "Create" and drag the icon to a suitable
directory.

The configure option on the pop-up menu allows you to add your name
and web site into the generated AppInfo.xml file.
