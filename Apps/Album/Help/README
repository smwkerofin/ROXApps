		Album
		Package digital audio files into an application
		By Stephen Watson

Overview
========
Album creates application directories containing digital audio files
(MP3 or Ogg/Vorbis).  When you run the created application, it loads
the audio into xmms.

Installation
============
Copy the application directory to somewhere useful, usually ~/Apps or 
/usr/local/apps.  

Updates
=======
This program is available at http://www.kerofin.demon.co.uk/rox/album.html
or via Zero Install at
/uri/0install/www.kerofin.demon.co.uk/apps/Album

Future plans
============
I hope to add support for MusicBox as an alternative to xmms.
