Clock
=====

Clock is an applet for use in a ROX-Filer panel or pinboard.  It
tells the time.  It can also be run as a stand-alone program.

When running stand-alone, click mouse button 3 to access a pop-up
window.  From this you have four options:

 * Info         - Display information on the program

 * Configure... - Sets up the clock face display options

 * Alarms...    - Simple alarm clock facility

 * Quit         - Quits the program.

You can get the same menu from the applet, or the default panel menu
(which will allow you to remove the applet) by changing a compile time
option.  Load Clock/src/clock.c and find the line beginning 
#define APPLET_MENU
Set this to 0 to have the normal panel menu, or a non-zero value to
have the clock menu.

The user-defined format for the text below the clock face is in
strfime(3) format.  Consult the man page for that function to find out
how to set up various formats.

If you have multiple copies of Clock running (say one in a window and
one on a panel) and an alarm is due to go off then each copy of Clock
will display the alarm.
