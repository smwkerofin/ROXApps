Mail
====

This is an applet which indicates whether or not you have new mail.
You can also use it to launch your favourite mail client.

Installing
----------

Copy it where you want it to be.  It is written in Python so there is
no need to compile.

Choosing a mail client
----------------------

Right click on the Mail applet to pop-up its menu and select "Select
mailer".  Choose your prefered client or click on "New mailer" to
define a new one.

        Name: Unique name for the client

    Location: File name of the command to run

Read command: Either just '%s' for a GUI client or 'xterm -e %s' for a
	      command line program.  Below this is an example of the
	      command.

Send command: How to send a file, in terms of
		  %(Command)s	  file name of command
		  %(Subject)s	  subject of email
		  %(To)s	  intended recipient of file
		  %(File)s	  path of file to send
	      Below this is an example command.

Sending a file
--------------

Drag the file to the Mail icon and fill in the details in the window
which opens.
                To: email address to send the file to
           Subject: subject of the email
  Encode as binary: select if file is not text (uses uuencode)
              Send: click to send the file

Check mail programs
-------------------

This menu option lets you set up one or more programs to be called at regular
intervals to fetch mail from servers.  I don't recommend using this option, 
setting up fetchmail to run in daemon mode is a much better idea.

Bugs
----

A message similar to 
  Gtk-WARNING **: gtk_signal_disconnect_by_data(): could not find
  handler containing data (0xFC6E8) 
appears at start up.  I don't know why.

Other bugs (or a fix for the one listed above) should be reported to
