Thumbs
======

This program has two main functions

* Purging unwanted thumbnail images from the thumbnail cache.
* Setting the application which creates thumbnails for a given type

Purging the Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the main option and shown when running the program without any
files.  It may spend some time scanning your thumbnail directory then it will
list the available thumbnail catagories, normally 'normal' plus possibly
'fail' or 'large' along with the number of entries in each catagory and the 
size used on the disk.

Once you select a catagory you have four options:

1) Show.  This opens a filer window showing the files in that catagory

2) Purge old.  Select an age in days then click on this button to delete all
generated thumbnails in that catagory which are older than that age.

3) Purge missing.  Click on this button to delete the thumbnails for files
which are no longer present.

4) Purge changed.  Click on this button to delete the thumbnails for files
which have changed since the thumbnail was created.

Right click for a menu to allow you to refresh the listing or manage the
thumbnail helpers.

Setting the Thumbnail Helper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This window is available from the "Manage thumbnailers" menu option or when 
running the program with a file as an argument.

First drop a file in the upper part of the window.  This determines the type
of file to manage.  If you ran the program with an argument and it was a file
then that file is already set.

The lower part of the window shows the currently set handler for that file 
type, or a question mark if none is set.  Drag an application to set it for 
the selected file type.

The program will first attempt to create a thumbnail for the file from which 
the type was derived and display it.  If it is acceptable click on Ok to
set the handler.
