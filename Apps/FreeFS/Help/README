FreeFS
======

FreeFS displays a small window showing the disk usage of a single file
system.  There are three ways to select the file system monitored:

1) Run the program.  The file system monitored is either the one where
the program resides (if you ran it with the full pathname, or via the
wrapper), or the current directory.

2) Run the program with a file or directory argument (or use ROX-Filer
to drag a file or directory to its wrapper).

3) Run the program, then drag a file or directory into its window.

The window displays the file system mount point, the total size of the
file system, the used size and the size available.

Hold down the right mouse button for a menu.  From this menu you can
change the update rate or quit the program.

This has only been tried under Solaris 7.  Reports of success/failure
under other OS's to stephen@kerofin.demon.co.uk please.

Bugs

FreeFS starts with the wrong time interval highlighted on its menus.

Credits
-------

Most of the drag and drop code was lifted from ROX-Filer by Thomas
Leonard, as was the AppRun file.

The design of the window came from the replacement RISC OS Free
templates by Bernard Veasey.
