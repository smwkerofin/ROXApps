XAttr shows the extended attributes assigned to a file.

Usage
=====

Drag a file to the XAttr icon.  A dialog window pops up showing a list of
extended attributes and their values, shown as a text string.  Double click 
on a row to edit the value.

Click on the Add button to add a new attribute and set its value.  Note that 
under Linux the name of the attribute must contain a '.' character and under
Solaris it cannot contain a '/' character.

Attribute values are classed as "STRING", "TEXT" or "DATA".  "STRING"
and "TEXT" must be valid UTF-8, and "TEXT" may contain '\n'
characters.  "DATA" values cannot be edited or created, only viewed.
