Depend
======

A ROX utility for checking dependencies of other ROX utilities.

To Install
----------

De-archive the program and copy it to somewhere you can find it again.
I suggest ~/Apps.

Using the program (as a user)
-----------------------------

Drag ROX utilities to Depend.  A window will open listing the
program's dependencies (if they have been declared, see below) and
whether or not Depend could find them.  To test another program either
drag it the open window to re-use it or to Depend to start up another
instance. 

Using the program (as a developer)
----------------------------------

Depend reads dependency information from the AppInfo.xml file.  Here
is an extract from Clock/AppInfo.xml

  <Dependencies>
    <AppDir><Name>ROX-CLib</Name><NeedsVersion>2.1.0</NeedsVersion></AppDir>
  </Dependencies>

This means that Clock depends on an AppDir called ROX-CLib and that it
must be version 2.1.0 or later.  Clock also depends on a host of other
stuff, including GTK+ 2.0, but these are not listed because ROX-CLib
depends on it also and it is assumed that ROX-CLib's dependencies have
all been resolved.  Future versions of Depend may (optionally) check
recursivly for AppDir dependencies.

The list of implemented dependency types below.  Each must contain a
Name element and may contain a NeedsVersion element.

* AppDir
  An application directory called Name, which should reside in either
  $PATH or $LIBDIRPATH ($HOME/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib).  If
  NeedsVersion is specified then the app's AppInfo.xml is checked.

* Program
  An executable file called Name which should reside in $PATH.
  NeedsVersion is ignored.

* Library
  A shared library called Name which should reside in $LIBDIRPATH
  ($HOME/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib).  If NeedsVersion is specified
  then libName.so.version is looked for, otherwise libName.so

* Python
  A python module called Name.  NeedsVersion is ignored.

* Package
  A pkg-config package called Name.  NeedsVersion is checked, if
  specified.
