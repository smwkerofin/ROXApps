Launch
======

Program for launching URLs.

There are three modes of operation:
   Launch -o                - Show the options window to set up the launchers
   Launch /path/to/file.uri - Launch the URL found in the file
   Launch sheme://host/path - Launch the URL given on the command line

The file menu in ROX-Filer will show an "Options" item, this shows the options
window.

There are two options you can set:
  http handler - this determines the handler used for http, https and
 		 any other scheme without a handler set
  ftp handler  - handler for ftp: URL's

The default option runs mozilla to show the URL in a new window.

The file: scheme is hard coded to use ROX-Filer.
