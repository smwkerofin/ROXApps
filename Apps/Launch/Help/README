Launch
======

Program for launching URLs.

There are three modes of operation:
   Launch -o                 - Show the options window to set up the launchers
   Launch /path/to/file.uri  - Launch the URL found in the file
   Launch scheme://host/path - Launch the URL given on the command line

The file menu in ROX-Filer will show an "Options" item, this shows a window
for defining schemes and the program used to handle them..

The file: scheme is hard coded to use ROX-Filer.  The http: scheme handler 
will be initialized to the value of the $BROWSER variable, which is normally 
set by ROX-Session.

Setting handlers
----------------

First select the scheme you want to set up, either by entering the name or
by selecting it from the drop-down list.

Then you can either drop an application or program to the drop target area 
(which will immediately set it) or type in a command string (don't forget
to use "$@" to represent the URI that will be passed to it) and press enter.

If a scheme handler is already set, Launch will ask you to confirm that you 
want to change it.

Clicking on the Help button will show this text in a window.

If you need to use a proxy, you must set it in the environment before
running the program, e.g.
$ http_proxy=http://proxy.my.isp:8080/ export http_proxy
