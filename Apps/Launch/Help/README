Launch
======

Program for launching URLs.

There are three modes of operation:
   Launch -o                 - Show the options window to set up the launchers
   Launch /path/to/file.uri  - Launch the URL found in the file
   Launch scheme://host/path - Launch the URL given on the command line

The file menu in ROX-Filer will show an "Options" item, this shows a window
for defining schemes and the program used to handle them..

The file: scheme is hard coded to use ROX-Filer.

If you need to use a proxy, you must set it in the environment before
running the program, e.g.
$ http_proxy=http://proxy.my.isp:8080/ export http_proxy
