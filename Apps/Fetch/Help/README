		Fetch
		A helper application for ROX-Filer
		By Stephen Watson

Overview
========
Fetch gets files from the network.  It is designed to be used as the
download handler for ROX-Filer 2.1.2 or later.  

Installation
============
Copy the application directory to somewhere useful, usually ~/Apps or 
/usr/local/apps.  Then in ROX-Filer Options select "Drag and Drop" and as the
download handler enter "/path/Fetch/AppRun %s", where /path is the directory
you stored the Fetch application.

The program is then run automatically when a file dragged to a
ROX-Filer window is to be fetched from the net.

If you run the program independantly it will show the options window
to allow you to configure it manually.

Updates
=======
