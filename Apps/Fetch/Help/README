		Fetch
		A helper application for ROX-Filer
		By Stephen Watson

Overview
========
Fetch gets files from the network.  It is designed to be used as the
download handler for ROX-Filer 2.1.2 or later.  

Installation
============
Copy the application directory to somewhere useful, usually ~/libs or 
/usr/local/lib.  Then in ROX-Filer Options select "Drag and Drop" and as the
download handler enter "/path/Fetch/AppRun %s", where /path is the directory
you stored the Fetch application.

The program is then run automatically when a file dragged to a
ROX-Filer window is to be fetched from the net.

If you run the program independently it will show the options window
to allow you to configure it manually.

Display
=======
Fetch displays a number of pieces of information about the current download.
Some of these require that the web server it connects to volunteers the data, 
such as the size of the file to be downloaded.  

The server can also disagree with ROX about what MIME type the data
is.  If the server claims the type is text/plain when the local type
is something different then this usually means the server has not been
properly configured for that type.  However if the server sends the
text/html type when ROX is expecting something else this usually means
that it has actually sent an error document and that the fetch has in
fact failed.  Fetch may warn you of this.

Updates
