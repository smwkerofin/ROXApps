SystemTrayN
===========

SystemTrayN is an updated version of SystemTray 0.2.

Below is the original README file for SystemTray.

SystemTray 0.1
===============

SystemTray is an applet that shows the status of various applications
on a computer.  It is compatible with the freedesktop.org notification
area spec so it can be used with programs compatible with either gnome
2.2 or future versions of KDE.  .

To use it, just drag it to your panel.  Icons in the system tray can
display important messages in a small window near the tray.  Click on
the window to acknowledge the message.

The only bug I know of at the moment is that if you delete a panel or
log out with the applet running, it will print some debuging messages.
This appears to be a gtk bug.
