Tail
====

This program displays the contents of a file in a read-only text
window, updating as the file is updated.  It is designed to do the
same function as the "tail -f" command.

To set the file to display, either:
* drag a file to its icon in the filer, 
* drag a file to it as it runs,
* use the "File=>Open File.." menu option
* use it as the end of a pileline.
