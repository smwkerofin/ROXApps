NetHack
=======

A front end for nethack 3.3.1

This python program serves as a front end to the Nethack game.
Nethack allows you to specify a file of options, passed in the
NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable.  This front end lets you manage
those files, called profiles here.

To set the profiles, drag suitable files from the filer.  To run
nethack with a profile highlight in the list, then click on "Start
game".  If no profile is highlighted then the default options set by
your login environment are used.

You can also choose your character name, or if you are starting a new
game, your race and profession.  These last two default to "Ask" which
will have nethack use the usual dialouges to select them.

The latest version is at http://www.kerofin.demon.co.uk/rox/
