README for Mem
==============

Mem - display memory and swap space usage.

This program, which can function as a ROX applet or a standalone program, 
displays the current real memory usage and the current swap space usage.
It obtains these values by using the libgtop library.  If libgtop is
not available then alternative means are used.  These work on Linux
and Solaris, but may not on other systems.

Bugs
----

A bug in libgtop means that it cannot calculate the swap space values
under Solaris.  The alternate method is used.  These values do not
match those shown by the swap command because that shows the overall
virtual memory usage not just the swap usage.

Sometimes the values aren't available.  This shows as the guages droppping
to zero momentarily.
