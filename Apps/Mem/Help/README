README for Mem
==============

Mem - display memory and swap space usage.

This program, which can function as a ROX applet or a standalone program, 
displays the current real memory usage and the current swap space usage.
It obtains these values by using the libgtop library.

Bugs
----

The swap space display is broken under Solaris, apparently a bug in libgtop.
This is disabled until a fixed libgtop is available.
