DownloadManager
===============

DownloadManager is a program for managing downloads for the ROX desktop.
By allowing only a limited number (usually 1) of clients to download
files simultaineously it allows better use of a finite resource,
namely your bandwidth.

Usage
-----

Start DownloadManager, either directly from ROX-Filer or automatically
by linking it into ~/Choices/ROX-Session/AutoStart.

It will wait in the background until contacted by one or more
clients.  If it is delaying the start of a client then it will open a
window to show the download queue, then close it again when the queue
is closed.

At the time of writing the only client available is Fetch version
0.0.7 or later.

Requirements
------------

ROX-Lib2
DBUS version 0.22 (earlier or later versions not tested).

Adding DownloadManager support to a client
------------------------------------------

Provided is DownloadManager/dclient.py for Python programs to use to
interface with DownloadManager.  See Fetch 0.0.7 (or later) for an
example of use, or read the documentation strings in dclient.py.

You can use the other language bindings supported by DBUS to contact
DownloadManager but no documentation is yet available.  (Help
gratefully received).
