=======

A wrapper for the xplanet program.

Normal use
~~~~~~~~~~

Running XPlanet will show the options window by default, but the action 
to perform can be chosen.

Right clicking on the icon in ROX-Filer will give two options, "Options" and
"Set as backdrop App".

current planet as the pinboard image, updating every few minutes.  There
are two relevant options:

               man xplanet for more details on the other bodies).
 
  Minutes between update      How often the backdrop image updates.

Options
-------

Right click on XPlanet's icon and select "Options".  You can choose the 
executable to run, the default run action, and options for backdop and 
windowed mode.
