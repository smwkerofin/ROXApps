XPlanet
=======

A wrapper for the xplanet program.

Normal use
----------

Running XPlanet simply runs the xplanet program with default options
and shows the result in a window.  In future it may be possible to
change the defaults, but not yet.

Pinboard backdrop
-----------------

This is the more useful mode.

Right click on XPlanet's icon and select "Set as backdrop App".  This
will set XPlanet as ROX-Filers backdrop application and draw the
current planet as the pinboard image, updating every few minutes.

Options
-------

Right click on XPlanet's icon and select "Options".
